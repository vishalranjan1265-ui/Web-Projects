            <h1>India</h1>
            <div class="infobox">
                <p>India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South asia</a>. It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area">seventh-largest country by area</a>; the most populous country since 2023; and, since its independence in 1947, the
                    world's most populous democracy.[22][23][24] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian
                    Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan
                    to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In
                    the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a
                    maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia.

                    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years
                    ago.[26][27][28] Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the
                    region highly diverse.[29] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the
                    Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the
                    third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had
                    diffused into India from the northwest.[31][32] Its hymns recorded the early dawnings of Hinduism in
                    India.[33] India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions.[34] By
                    400 BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming
                    social orders unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit
                    Maurya and Gupta Empires.[37] This era was noted for creativity in art, architecture, and
                    writing,[38] but the status of women declined,[39] and untouchability became an organised
                    belief.[l][40] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious
                    cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[41]

                    In the 1st millennium, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on
                    India's southern and western coasts.[42] In the early centuries of the 2nd millennium Muslim armies
                    from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains.[43] The resulting Delhi Sultanate
                    drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[44] In south India, the
                    Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[45] In the Punjab, Sikhism
                    emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[46] The Mughal Empire ushered in two centuries of
                    economic expansion and relative peace,[47] and left a rich architectural legacy.[48][49] Gradually
                    expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a colonial economy but
                    consolidated its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians
                    were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of
                    education and the public life took root.[53] A nationalist movement emerged in India, the first in
                    the non-European British Empire and an influence on other nationalist movements.[54][55] Noted for
                    nonviolent resistance after 1920,[56] it became the primary factor in ending British rule.[57] In
                    1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority
                    dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an
                    unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.[58]

                    India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It
                    is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in
                    1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023.[59] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from
                    US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute
                    country in 1951,[60] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information
                    technology services, with an expanding middle class.[61] India has reduced its poverty rate, though
                    at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[62] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in
                    military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China,
                    unresolved since the mid-20th century.[63] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are
                    gender inequality, child malnutrition,[64] and rising levels of air pollution.[65] India's land is
                    megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed
                    with tolerance in its culture,[66] is supported in protected habitats.</p>
